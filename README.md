# CLIProxyAPI-Extended

> Fork of [CLIProxyAPIPlus](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPIPlus) with advanced Canonical IR architecture and full Ollama compatibility.

[![Original Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Original-router--for--me%2FCLIProxyAPI-blue)](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI)
[![Plus Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Plus-router--for--me%2FCLIProxyAPIPlus-green)](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPIPlus)

## Why This Fork?

This fork pioneered the **Canonical IR architecture** before the official Plus version. As of January 28, 2026, it synchronizes with [CLIProxyAPIPlus](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPIPlus) while maintaining unique improvements:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Full Ollama Compatibility** | Complete bidirectional protocol support (`/api/chat`, `/api/generate`) with streaming — use any provider through Ollama API |
| **KiloCode Integration** | Built-in KiloCode provider with free models support (via Kilo gateway) and full device-auth login flow |
| **Enhanced Stability** | Improved compatibility with Cursor, Copilot Chat, and other AI coding clients |
| **Advanced Architecture** | Refined Canonical IR implementation with 54% codebase reduction (17,464 → 7,992 lines) |

**Canonical IR benefits:**
- Hub-and-spoke model eliminates N×M translation paths
- Type-safe `UnifiedChatRequest` with compile-time guarantees
- Single `UnifiedEvent` type for SSE/NDJSON/binary protocols
- Zero-allocation `gjson`-based parsers
- 54% codebase reduction (17,464 → 7,992 lines)

---

## Quick Start

New configuration options:

```yaml
use-canonical-translator: true   # Canonical IR architecture (default)
show-provider-prefixes: false    # Visual provider prefixes (default)
```

**Provider prefixes:** Visual identification in model list (e.g., `[Gemini CLI] gemini-2.5-flash`). Purely cosmetic — models work with or without prefix.

**Provider selection:** Without prefix (or with prefixes disabled), system uses **round-robin** for load balancing.

**Note:** Ollama API requires `use-canonical-translator: true`

## Architecture

**Hub-and-spoke** with unified Intermediate Representation (IR):

```
    OpenAI ─────┐                       ┌───── OpenAI
    Claude ─────┤                       ├───── Claude
    Ollama ─────┼─────► Canonical ◄─────┼───── Gemini (AI Studio)
      Kiro ─────┤       IR              ├───── Gemini CLI
   Copilot ─────┘                       ├───── Antigravity
                                        └───── Ollama
```

**Result:** 21 files (7 parsers + 7 emitters + 6 IR core + 1 adapter), 7,992 lines

| Metric                    | Legacy        | Canonical IR  | Δ         |
|---------------------------|---------------|---------------|-----------|
| Files                     | 99            | 21            | **−79%**  |
| Lines of code             | 17,464        | 7,992         | **−54%**  |
| Translation paths         | N×M           | 2N (hub)      | **−48%**  |

## Ollama Compatibility

The proxy acts as a **full Ollama-compatible server** — clients can use any provider through Ollama API:

```
Ollama client (/api/chat, /api/generate)
    ↓ parse directly to IR (no OpenAI conversion)
Canonical IR
    ↓ convert to provider format
Provider (Gemini/Claude/OpenAI/etc.)
    ↓ response through IR
Ollama response (streaming/non-streaming)
```

**Recommended:** Run on port `11434` for maximum client compatibility.

**Use case:** IDEs with Ollama support but without OpenAI API (e.g., some Copilot Chat configurations).

**Key Features:**
- Reasoning/Thinking blocks with `reasoning_tokens` tracking
- Tool calls with unified ID generation
- Multimodal support (images, PDF, inline data)
- Streaming: SSE (OpenAI/Claude), NDJSON (Gemini/Ollama)
- Responses API (`/v1/responses`)

**Known Issues:**
- Antigravity GPT-OSS: thinking mode disabled (infinite planning loops)
- CLI agents (Aider, etc.): not tested

## Authentication

### KiloCode
KiloCode is supported as a first-class provider with a built-in device-auth login flow (no API key required for free-tier models).

### Other Providers
Full OAuth2 flows with auto browser opening (Gemini, Claude, Codex, GitHub Copilot, etc.) — see [original documentation](https://help.router-for.me/)
